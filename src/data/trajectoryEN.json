 "Graduated in Tourism by CENP A Coruña (UDC). In third year of university I had the chance to enjoy an Erasmus program in Valmiera (Latvia), in Vidzemes Augskola of Applied Sciences, where all subjects (except from latvian) were given in english.",
 "While I was going to the University, I began my professional careeer in hospitality. I worked for NH Hotels in Spain (NH Atlántico, A Coruña) and Belgium (NH Grand Place Arenberg, Brussels) as a front desk agent.",
 "When I finished my universitary studies I moved to Prague (Czech Republic). There I worked during two years for Eurostars Hotels as Director's Assistant in a 5 stars hotel (Eurostars Thalia), and I got in touch with what would become my specialty in the sector: Revenue Management and sales and market analysis.",
  "In 2013 I was offered a transfer to Madrid, as Reservations Manager in Eurostars Madrid Tower (the flagship of the chain in the city). I was working there during two years, and my main tasks were: reservations' team coordination, budgeting, forecasting, online content reviews, facturation, customer support, etc.",
 "In 2015 I managed to enter the Revenue department of the chain. During this period I specialized in sells and demand analysis, budgeting and forecasting, short-term forecasting and sales of large groups.",
"From year 2016 to 2018 I had the opportunity to collaborate on a large-scale project of the company. It was a project to change the hotel management system used so far to the SAP TMS system. My role was initially 'key user' for the individual reservations area, and my main tasks were the review and adaptation of the new system to the needs of the chain and the creation of system manuals in Spanish and English. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to be coordinator of one of the systems implementation teams and responsible for the Groups and Events area, the tasks to be performed were the extraction and migration of data, preparation and installation of new peripheral equipment needed, training of the staff and subsequent support in each of the assigned hotels. The project was international and all materials and processes were offered in Spanish and English.",
"In 2018, I wanted to acquire the perspective of other sectors towards my area of ​​specialization, I started working as a Senior Price Analyst in the Goldcar Rent a Car team (low-cost brand of Europcar Mobility Group). During this period my main tasks were reviewing demand and competitors, review of opportunity dates, review of inventory needs and relationship with the fleet team, creation of performance reports and weekly meetings with international intermediaries.",
  "In 2020, after 10 years working for Tourism (7 of them as a Pricing and Sells analyst), I decided to update my professional profile and learn front-end development. Carrying out sales and results analysis tasks has always entailed the review of content and online presence in detail, this together with having worked side by side with developers on previous occasions made me grow a great curiosity towards the world of development and how products can be tailored to end-user needs, as well as refining processes. To start my programming journey, I chose the Adalab bootcamp.",
  "Since I finished Adalab I have not stopped being interested in the news of the sector and new ways to cover and complete my training. Today I am fluent in HTML and CSS for layout, and I use JavaScript for interactivity as a programming language. The framework with which I currently feel most comfortable is React, although I also have notions of jQuery. In addition, I know the bases of node.js and SQLite for creating servers and managing databases. I am used to work with Trello and Notion and I know the Agile philosophy for projects management. When it comes to web design, I have used Zeplin and Figma. ",
  "I am currently strengthening knowledge and acquiring more, especially in the areas of accessibility, UX and UI. In addition, I design and carry out small personal projects."
